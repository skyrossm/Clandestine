# Clandestine
 Travel to the magical dimension named Clandestine. Move throughout the Arcane worlds and unlock new hidden powers that help your overall damage profile. At the same time have the chance to gain very powerful equipment that can be upgraded and RNG re-rolled.
 
Currently very WIP, no release versions yet. You can download and build the mod yourself to playtest early.
 
# What you can and cannot do
- You CAN:
    Do whatever, I don't care. Steal the code, yoink the textures.
    Modpacks need no attribution but is always appreciated.
    Update to newer versions cause you know I won't

- You CANNOT:
    Just don't try to reupload it as your own mod without changing something.
